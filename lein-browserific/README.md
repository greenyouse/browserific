# lein-Browserific

A Leiningen plugin for ClojureScript app developement.

## Status

A first draft of the pre-processor has been done but there are some
issues with it still.

The next major item is a GUI for writing project config files.

## Installation

This project has not been released yet, so it will need to be cloned and
installed manually for now.

## Basic Configuration

There are two options to be aware of for the project.clj file:

```clj
:browserific {:config "some/location/config.edn"
              :source-paths "another/spot"}
```

`:config` denotes a special location for the app's configuration
file. If no option is specified, the default is to use `src/config.edn`.

`:source-paths` points to the ClojureScript files of your app. The
default location is `src`.

## Usage

Once the configuration has been writen and your app is coded, the files
can be compiled with either:

```sh
$ lein browserific once

$ lein browserific auto
```

To erase the files that were previously generated by browserific, run:

```sh
$ lein browserific clean
```

Exhaustive sample files exist for how to write a `config.edn` for each
of the three platforms. They can be viewed using:

```sh
# Gives all config options
$ lein browserific sample

# Gives only mobile config options
$ lein browserific mobile
```

Using the config GUI should _vastly_ simplify the `config.edn` writing
process. To turn this tool on, do:

```sh
$ lein browserific config
```
and then navigate to http://localhost:4242 with a web browser.
