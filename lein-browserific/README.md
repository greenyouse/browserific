# lein-Browserific

A Leiningen plugin for ClojureScript app developement.

## Status

The pre-processor and config GUI are both done. Next up is adding all
the mobile platforms and trying a re-designing of the compiling
process. There must be an easier way than forcing 15+ different
compilations.

After a little more tweaking and testing, I'll push out the first
version. 

## Installation

This project has not been released yet, so it will need to be cloned and
installed manually for now.

## Basic Configuration

There are two options to be aware of for the project.clj file:

```clj
:browserific {:config "some/location/config.edn"
              :source-paths "another/spot"}
```

`:config` denotes a special location for the app's configuration
file. If no option is specified, the default is to use `src/config.edn`.

`:source-paths` points to the ClojureScript files of your app. The
default location is `src`.

## Usage

Once the configuration has been writen and your app is coded, the files
can be compiled with either:

```sh
$ lein browserific build

$ lein auto browserific build
```

To erase the files that were previously generated by browserific, run:

```sh
$ lein browserific clean
```

Exhaustive sample files exist for how to write a `config.edn` for each
of the three platforms. They can be viewed using:

```sh
# Gives all config options
$ lein browserific sample

# Gives only mobile config options
$ lein browserific mobile
```

Using the config GUI should _vastly_ simplify the `config.edn` writing
process. To turn this tool on, do:

```sh
$ lein browserific config
```
and then navigate to http://localhost:50000 with a web browser. The
framework tries to auto-load the page, however, it has a problem 
and requires reloading the webpage by hand.
