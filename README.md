# Browserific

A project for cross-browser compatible extensions and cross-device apps 
in ClojureScript.


## Status
This project is under active developement but is not close (at all) to being
usable yet. I set up a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/hDlRgiHo/browserific) board
to organize the developement workflow, foster ideas, and discuss some of the
design decisions. If you're thinking of contributing please join the board.

The docs folder has some helpful notes on browser details and an overview of the 
project design.
