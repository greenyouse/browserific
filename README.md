# Browserific

Browserific is a framework for building apps in ClojureScript. 

This is intended to be a one-stop for ClojureScript apps that run
on mobile, desktop, or as browser-extensions (wip). Currently,
browserific targets Cordova for mobile, NodeJS for desktop, and
Firefox's Open Web Apps framework for desktop and FirefoxOS
(mobile). Browser extensions that run on Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and 
Safari are future goals for this project.


## Status

This project is under active developement but not quite ready for
use. A first version of the template has been pushed out and the
leiningen plugin is close to being done but has yet to be released. The
general library is just getting started.


## Contributing

I set up a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/hDlRgiHo/browserific) board
to organize the developement workflow, foster ideas, and discuss some of the
design decisions. If you're thinking of contributing please join the board.

There are still many things in the works but the biggest item to help
with would be browser extensions (see the browser extension branch).
