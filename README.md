# Browserific
--------------

A project for cross-browser compatible extensions and cross-device mobile apps
(using Cordova) in ClojureScript.


## Status
----------
This project is under active developement but is not close (at all) to being
usable yet. I set up a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/hDlRgiHo/browserific) board
to organize the developement workflow, foster ideas, and discuss some of the
design decisions. If you're thinking of contributing please join the board.

The docs folder will (eventualy) have design ideas, docs, and dev notes but 
right now it doesn't have anything very useful in it.
