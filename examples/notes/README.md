# notes

This is a (terribly) minimal example that shows one way of using
Browserific and some other tools to make a little app. The app is not
100% functional but I think it gives a pretty good idea of how to use
the framework. 

The FirefoxOS version is compiled in
`resources/mobile/notes/platforms/firefoxos/www` if you want to see the
app in action. A desktop version also exists for linux32 but is
unfinished. Try adding platforms and tweaking parts yourself.
